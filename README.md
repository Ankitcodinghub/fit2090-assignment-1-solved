Learning Objectives

‚óè By completing this assignment, students will be able to (a) create a business process model based on a given problem and (b) document and communicate a business process using standard notations of the process modelling techniques.

Group Assignment:

‚óè This assignment promotes students‚Äô collaborations working in pairs. Students must form their paired grouping within the same tutorial, the latest being the end of week 5. You will choose your group via the Assignment One Groups (see Moodle Assessments page).

Submission Requirements

‚óè You are required to submit the assignment via Moodle as an MS Word or PDF formatted document. The file names should include the Unit Code, assignment number and your Group ID number, following either of these formats:

FIT2090A1_GroupID.docx OR FIT2090A1_GroupID.pdf

‚óè Only one of the group members will submit the assignment for the group.

Scenario1

hospital/medical centre, there is a contact person for mattress ordering ‚Äì also known as requestor. A requestor can make an order on behalf of the patient, through phone or by email. When the requestor places an order, SAM delivers the mattress to the designated ward in the hospital/medical centre. The drivers will unpack and inflate the mattress for the patients. At the end of the rental period (i.e. when a mattress is no longer needed), the requestor will inform SAM to collect the mattress from the its current location. These mattresses will then be sanitised (e.g. cleaned, sterilised, disinfected), repacked and stored in SAM‚Äôs storeroom, ready for its next use.

Currently, SAM uses a simple rental management system to manage and record all orders. The current rental management system records the product information, client details, client‚Äôs order requirements, delivery and collections information. As a result of a recent increase in demand for their mattresses, SAM requires a more effective system to manage their rental processes. Therefore, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and owner of SAM has hired your business consulting firm to analyse their current business processes and propose a more effective rental management system. A priority of the proposed system should be improved efficiency in the day-to-day business operations.

The current rental process is as follows. When a patient needs a specialised mattress, the requestor can either call or email SAM‚Äôs clerk to inform them about the requirements of the mattress. Either way, the clerk first checks the existence of the client and Patient Unique Identifier (PUID) by entering the PUID into the system. If this is a new client or a new patient, the clerk will add their information to the Client master data and the Patient master data, respectively. Then, the clerk will retrieve the patient information, mattress type/size needed, etc., from the database. The clerk will then retrieve the delivery details from the database and lodge the order.

When the mattress is no longer needed, the requestor will inform SAM‚Äôs clerk, and the collection process is carried out by a driver, similar to the delivery process.

Finally, the clerk sends the invoice to the client‚Äôs accountant. Then, the accountant pays the mattress rental fees via EFTPOS, BPAY, or credit card, and sends a copy of the invoice to the patient. The clerk will update the payment information in the Order event data.

If the patient claims from their health insurance, the clerk will collect information about the insurance and send an invoice to their insurance company.
